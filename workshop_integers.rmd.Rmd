## Method 1: print numbers individually

```{r}
print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
print(4)
print(5)
print(6)
print(7)
print(8)
print(9)
print(10)
```

## Method 2: print numbers 1 to 10

```{r}
print(1:10)
```

## Method 3: using "for" loop

```{r}
for(i in (1:10)) {    # r does not understand x(1:10) it should just be i in (1:10)
  print(i)            # loop variable should be i not x
}
```


## Method 4: using "while" loop

```{r}
x <- 1

while (x <= 10) {
  print (x)
  x = x + 1
}
```
